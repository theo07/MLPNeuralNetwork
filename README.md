# MLPNeuralNetwork
A Multilayer Perceptron for binary label prediction

Simple but robust experiment showing that neural networks can outperform
other machine learning algorithms (KNN, SVM, GaussianNB)

Jupyter Notebook is used to run the experiment, hence if script is open
sample output can be seen.

MLP built with TensorFlow

Data Preprocessing using Multicore and an Embedding layer for categorical
and continous data.

#TODO
Train the embedding layer too
