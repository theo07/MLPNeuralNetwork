# MLPNeuralNetwork
A Multilayer Perceptron for binary label prediction

Simple but robust experiment showing that neural networks can outperform
other machine learning algorithms (KNN, SVM, GaussianNB)

See pages 6-10 from the following paper (mainly about RNN but reviews MLP in the specified pages): [A Critical Review of Recurrent Neural Networks for Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.00019.pdf)

**Jupyter Notebook is used to run the experiment, hence if script (MLPExperiment.ipynb) is open
sample output can be seen.**

MLP built with TensorFlow 1.2.0 and Python 3.5.3 through anaconda3

Data Preprocessing using Multicore and an Embedding layer for categorical
and continous data.

#TODO
Train the embedding layer too
